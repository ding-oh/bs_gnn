# Dataset
We used scPDB to divide the valid_data.set csv into a train-test set.

# Introduction
We increased the diversity and ease of training by dividing the scPDB by chain, but information about the binding site in multimers may be lost. The binding site binary is based on a 10Ã… radius from the center coordinates of the ligand.
